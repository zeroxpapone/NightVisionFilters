# NightVisionFilters <br>
Made this to play EFT in the night without night visors. Should be working with both Nvidia and AMD gpus since it uses Windows APIs. <br>
# How to use <br>
Download the .exe file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/zeroxpapone/NightVisionFilters/releases/tag/1.0) and run it. A settings.json file will be auto created in the same directory. <br>
I recommend checking that the default values ​​suit your tastes as I cannot guarantee that they will work well on all monitors. Hop on an offline raid to check them out. <br>
Shortcut to toggle "filters" on/off is CTRL + F10. It's not currently possible to change it, but I may implement it in the future if needed and requested. <br>
# Contacts <br>
